# Hello, I will help you understand basic python (It really basic)

# We will understand print() # Example 1, input() #Example 1 and #Example 2, list = , if, elif and else and lastly using equtions to in python 

#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
#Print the basic

# print("Hello world") 
# Output should be - Hello world - 
# One thing is important is don't forget to put "" 
# IF you don't active the function using ""  **It will show a error**


#Example 1 

# print("Hello, Coding class!") # OUTPUT - Hello, Coding class
# print("My name is ******") # OUTPUT - My name is ******

# Quiz 

# I want you print your name and why you are learning python!


#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#


# User input

# ver is veriable using = to assign the ver and it reference input 
# ver = input("Hello, What is your name?") # OUTPUT - Hello, What is your name? []  <-- user input
# THIS IS THE CODE ^^^ you can delete the hash to active the function

# user_input = input("This is like print functions")

# Example 1

# I will be using if and else statement if you don't understand go to if and elif statment or go to example 2

# question = input("Would you like to play?")

# THIS IS THE CODE ^^^ you can delete the hash to active the function

# Im making if statment to check the statement 

# if question == "yes" or question == "Yes":
    # print("Alright") # if user said Yes or yes it will print "alright"
# else:
    # print("Alright I have nice day!") # else going print "Alright I have nice day!"


#Example 2 

# user = input("Usermame ===> ") # Asking a user put username 
# print("Login works!") # print the function after function is done asking the input 2


# Quiz time!

# I want you create two input one username and one password and after username print Login works 
# After password print password works

# output Username: 
# Login works
# Password:
# password works

# Creating list 
# choose_a_veriable_of_your_choice = ("Mark", "Zack", "Miranda", "Zack", "Mary")
# choose_a_veriable_of_your_choice_1 = ["Mark", "Zack", "Miranda", "Zack", "Mary"]
 
# print(choose_a_veriable_of_your_choice) # Output: ('Mark', 'Zack', 'Miranda', 'Zack', 'Mary')
# print(choose_a_veriable_of_your_choice_1) # Output: ['Mark', 'Zack', 'Miranda', 'Zack', 'Mary']
#  first we are choosing any veriable then making list using () or [] then we are printing veriable because it reference the list

# x = ("Mark", "Zack", "Miranda", "Zack", "Mary")

# print(x[0])
