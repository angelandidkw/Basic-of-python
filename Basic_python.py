# Hello, I will help you understand basic python (It really basic)

# We will understand print() # Example 1, input() #Example 1 and #Example 2, list = , if, elif and else 

# CREATED BY angelandidkw ((GITHUB)
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
#Print the basic

# print("Hello world") 
# Output should be - Hello world - 
# One thing is important is don't forget to put "" 
# IF you don't active the function using ""  **It will show a error**


#Example 1 

# print("Hello, Coding class!") # OUTPUT - Hello, Coding class
# print("My name is ******") # OUTPUT - My name is ******

# Quiz 

# I want you print your name and why you are learning python!

# User input

# ver is veriable using = to assign the ver and it reference input 
# ver = input("Hello, What is your name?") # OUTPUT - Hello, What is your name? []  <-- user input
# THIS IS THE CODE ^^^ you can delete the hash to active the function

# user_input = input("This is like print functions")

# Example 1

# I will be using if and else statement if you don't understand go to if and elif statment or go to example 2   

# question = input("Would you like to play?")

# THIS IS THE CODE ^^^ you can delete the hash to active the function

# Im making if statment to check the statement 

# if question == "yes" or question == "Yes":
    # print("Alright") # if user said Yes or yes it will print "alright"
# else:
    # print("Alright I have nice day!") # else going print "Alright I have nice day!"


#Example 2 

# user = input("Usermame ===> ") # Asking a user put username 
# print("Login works!") # print the function after function is done asking the input 2


# Quiz time!

# I want you create two input one username and one password and after username print Login works 
# After password print password works

# output Username: 
# Login works
# Password:
# password works

# Creating list 

# choose_a_veriable_of_your_choice = ("Mark", "Zack", "Miranda", "Zack", "Mary")
# choose_a_veriable_of_your_choice_1 = ["Mark", "Zack", "Miranda", "Zack", "Mary"]
 
# print(choose_a_veriable_of_your_choice) # Output: ('Mark', 'Zack', 'Miranda', 'Zack', 'Mary')
# print(choose_a_veriable_of_your_choice_1) # Output: ['Mark', 'Zack', 'Miranda', 'Zack', 'Mary']
#  first we are choosing any veriable then making list using () or [] then we are printing veriable because it reference the list

# Example 1
# We are going call a veriable like mark
#x = ("Mark", "Zack", "Miranda", "Zack", "Mary")

#print(x[0]) # The reason we 0 because in list has numbers 
                                    #0       #1     #2        #3     #4
                                    # "Mark" "Zack" "Miranda" "Zack" "Mary"


#List of Numbers:
#numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

#List of Strings:

#fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "grape"]
#List of Mixed Types:


#mixed_list = [1, "hello", 3.14, True]

#List of Lists (Nested Lists):
#nested_list = [[1, 2, 3], ["a", "b", "c"], [True, False]]


#List of Tuples:
#coordinates = [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]
#
#List of Boolean Values:
#boolean_values = [True, False, True, True, False]
#
#List of Dictionaries:
#students = [
#    {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "grade": "A"},
#    {"name": "Bob", "age": 22, "grade": "B"},
#    {"name": "Charlie", "age": 24, "grade": "A"}
#]


#Empty List:
#empty_list = []


# There is whole lot what you can do with list but I can't through all of type list :)

# if,elif,else keywords 

    # Code to be executed if condition1 is true
#if condition1:
#elif condition2:
    # Code to be executed if condition2 is true
#else:
    # Code to be executed if none of the conditions are true

#username = input("Enter username: ")

#if username == "mark": # first going see username what did user input now if username is true or same as "mark" it is going print Welcome mark
    # print("Welcome mark") 

#elif username == "Zack": # If don't match mark but if it did match Zack going to say print Welcome Zach
    # print("Welcome Zach")
#else:
   # print("Welcome!") # Lastly if confition is not true it is going here else going print "Welcome "

# There lot more that you could with if, elif, else but I'm showing the basic and general basic
